Got it âœ… Letâ€™s break down what your `test_api.py` script is doing.

---

## **Purpose**

This script is designed to **test an ML model API** thatâ€™s assumed to be running locally on `http://localhost:8000`.
It verifies that the API is:

1. Up and running (health check).
2. Able to handle **single predictions**.
3. Able to handle **batch predictions**.
4. Handling errors gracefully.

---

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **Imports**

```python
import requests
import json
import time
```

* `requests` â†’ Used to send HTTP requests to the API.
* `json` â†’ For pretty-printing JSON responses.
* `time` â†’ Adds a delay before starting tests (gives the server time to start).

---

### **Function: test\_api()**

This contains all the test cases.

#### **1. Health Check**

```python
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/")
```

* Sends a `GET` request to `/` (root endpoint).
* Expected: The server should return some status info (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`).
* If it fails, the script exits.

---

#### **2. Single Prediction**

```python
data = {"features": [0.5, -1.2, 0.8]}
response = requests.post(f"{base_url}/predict", json=data)
```

* Sends a `POST` request to `/predict`.
* Body contains a **single sample** with 3 feature values.
* Expected: The model returns a **prediction** for this input.

---

#### **3. Batch Prediction**

```python
data = {
    "samples": [
        [0.5, -1.2, 0.8],
        [-0.3, 1.5, -0.7],
        [1.0, 0.5, -1.0]
    ]
}
response = requests.post(f"{base_url}/predict_batch", json=data)
```

* Sends a `POST` request to `/predict_batch`.
* Body contains multiple feature vectors.
* Expected: The model returns predictions for all samples in one response.

---

#### **4. Error Handling**

```python
data = {"features": [0.5]}  # Invalid - too few features
response = requests.post(f"{base_url}/predict", json=data)
```

* Sends a **bad request**: only 1 feature instead of 3.
* Expected: API should return an **error message** (e.g., 400 Bad Request with details).

---

### **Main Section**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Waiting for server to start...")
    time.sleep(2)
    test_api()
```

* Waits 2 seconds before running tests (to ensure the server has time to start).
* Then runs all the above tests in sequence.

---

## **Output Example**

When running, youâ€™d see something like:

```
Waiting for server to start...
Testing ML Model API...

1. Testing health check...
Status: 200
Response: {"status": "ok"}

2. Testing single prediction...
Status: 200
Response: {
  "prediction": 1
}

3. Testing batch prediction...
Status: 200
Response: {
  "predictions": [1, 0, 1]
}

4. Testing error handling...
Status: 400
Error response: {"error": "Invalid input: expected 3 features"}
```

---

ðŸ‘‰ This way, youâ€™re verifying **both functionality and robustness** of your API.

Do you want me to also show you how to **turn this into automated unit tests** (e.g., with `pytest`) so you donâ€™t need to manually read the print logs?
